# Rubik's Cube!


The 3 x 3 cube has more possible states than grains of sand in all of earth's deserts (10^40). To solve a cube you must find a sequence of turns that unscramble it.  This solve method is broken down into stages, solving one part of the cube at a time: first the top cross, then top corners, then middle sides, and so on... The cube is rendered using the JavaScript library Three.js.
